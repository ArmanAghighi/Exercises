# Medrick Bridge Tech Exercises

Welcome to your Unity Internship Program (I have to use these stuff more often)
...


## How to do the exercises
- Fork this repo
- Make your own branch for each exercise
  - For example if you're doing parser assignment, make a branch called `parser`
- Do the exercise and commit in your own branch, add each exercise to the respective folders.
- Make a pull request to your main branch and assign a mentor to review your code.
